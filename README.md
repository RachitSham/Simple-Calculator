ðŸŽ­ Simple-Console-Calculator !!

ðŸ“¦ In this calculator task, I have implemented Java OOP concepts, methods, and conditional loops to enable the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.

ðŸ“¦ I have used the Scanner class to take user input from the console.

ðŸ“¦ A while loop is used to allow continuous calculations based on the user's choice until they decide to exit the application.

ðŸ“¦ A calculator menu is presented to the user to select the desired operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on their requirement.

ðŸ“¦ The user's choice is captured through input, and if the user decides not to perform any operation, they can exit the calculator gracefully.

ðŸ“¦ Once an operation is selected, the user is prompted to enter two numbers on which the calculation will be performed.

ðŸ“¦ A switch statement is used to handle the selected operation. Based on the user's choice, the corresponding case is executed, and the result of the calculation is displayed.
